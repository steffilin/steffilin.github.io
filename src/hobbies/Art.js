                    <li>I'm interested in pretty much any craft and grew up drawing with charcoal, 
                        oil paint, goache, and acrylic. I love trying new things and have done digital painting
                        (I've made stickers and prints!), crocheting, knitting, making things with polymer clay, etc... 
                        My next art goal is to learn pottery!
